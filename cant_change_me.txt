Can't Change Me (Lydia Loveless)
---------------

Capo 2nd fret. Chords shown are root position shapes.

(Verse)

Am Dm (V1.1)
I said a lot of things last night
Am Dm
I'm sorry did I say that to you
C Dm Am (Dm Am quick if desired?) (V1.2)
I talk so much shit I forget who I'm talkin to

(V1.1)
And my mouth is like a sinking boat
(V1.1)
I keep throwing words out hoping I can keep afloat
(V1.2)
but the more I try to dry out the more I get soaked

("Chorus")
(V1.2)
Then I say I'm not as bad as I seem
(V1.2)
But I used to be better, honey can't you see?
(V1.2)
And you of all people should know that this ain't really me
(V1.2)
And that's gonna change how you feel about me but it won't change me

(Verse)
Somebody found me on the floor
I must've passed out from the two nights before
If you don't send my rotten ass to bed I'll quote god again
And don't tell me that hell ain't there
Cuz I feel it every morning whn I climb the stairs
tell me why can't I sleep?
Alright a drink should get me right

("Chorus")
And you didn't mean to be mean
But everything sounds more meaningful when you scream
If you really wanna raise your voice t me
That's gonna change how I feel about you baby but it won't change me

("Bridge" [Actually another "Chorus"])
And you can write me off as just white trash
But honey I know it don't take all that much to see that
And I swear that every hangover's gonna be my last
But it looks like only whiskey's gonna kick my ass and make me still come back

(Verse)
So Jesus guide me with your light
You can enlighten me man with everlasting insight
But I've had thoughts about you that are gonna keep you up at night
Cuz being good is killing me inside
I don't wanna go to bed on time tonight
Cuz that'll change who I am and honey that ain't right

("Chorus")
Then I'll say it's not all that bad
If I can't change who I am I shouldn't try so goddamn hard
And I just keep telling myself I guess it ain't eternity
And that's gonna change you you feel about me Jesus but it won't change me
