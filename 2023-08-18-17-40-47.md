Pillar of salt

I tended a loamy mass of love and teeth and bile on the morning that you found me
The same trowel and the same water and nothing really grows
The sallow branches of wilted carrot tops surround me
But fertile soil meant my blackened thumb, it never showed


I'm turning to salt
While I'm breaking my neck trying to catch a glimpse of your palaces burning
While I'm feeling my shins solidifying into the earth and
While I'm wondering if you still think about me
