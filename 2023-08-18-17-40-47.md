Pillar of salt

I tended a loamy mass of love and teeth and bile on the morning that you found me
But the soils not as rich as it once was
Sallow branches of my wilted carrot tops surround me
Digging madly in the now depleted dust

I wrote a hook and then I saw you that same evening
I'd say by accident but that would only be so true
Glancing back again for the second time this minute
Half joy half hope you're feeling this way too


I'm turning to salt
While I'm breaking my neck trying to catch a glimpse of your palaces burning
While I'm feeling my shins solidifying into the earth and
While I'm wondering if you still think about me
