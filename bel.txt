Bel

I put the picture you gave me up high on the day it was over
Face-down in a place I'd forget back behind the weed
Hoping maybe one day in a year or two I'd stumble upon it
And I'd remember your face and I'd call and we'd smoke and we'd just shoot the breeze

And you gave me a rug made of wicker
Out of obligation or pity or just to remove from your home
And I kept it long after hiding that photo
Because everyone visiting said it was cool

And the rug that'd you'd given me darling
That really embrightened the room
It cracked and it splintered each time I rolled over
The edge so I swapped with a friend for some shrooms

And the plan that I had find that photo someday
While cleaning or looking to get well
Well it never transpired, cause I never forgot
So it went in the bin with the frame I put it in with the hope and the memories of Bel.
