Wish I could pull off hammer-ons like someone on tiktok
but alas I'm just stuck here in E
Whatever adding a ninth will accomplish aesthetically
My hands will still shake when I sing
So making it minor or making it flat
really doesn't quite matter a bit
When you're out peddling amateur, hacky, derivative
glib and shit as commodity

And maybe it's a feature of capitalism
Maybe it's just that I suck
But watching those kids so much younger than me
Shred chimey whips costing more than my truck
I can't help but think that I'm doing it wrong
I can't help but feel like an amateur mime
Cuz twenty-five years in I can't jam and can't lead
And I still can't fucking stick to a line


You could be better, more technically good
A doing a whatever you may
Cause practice makes perfect and perfect is better
Cause better's the thing that gets paid


I could be better at hitting the notes
Or telling how far they're apart
But pitch can be sketchy and knobs are confusing
And skill isn't technically art
So crack me a cold one and throw it this way
I know it's my fifth it's ok
I know no one's coming to watch me melt faces
They're here for blood and for rotten black grapes

You could be better, more technically good
At doing a whatever you may
But blood is worth something and don't let them fool you
No matter how much you get paid
Yeah blood isn't worthless and don't let em fool you
No matter how much you get paid
