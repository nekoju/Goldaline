Baja Blast

The nicotine-jaundicted ceiling in the diner on that vapid Friday night
Hung low enough to make you want to listen
To the couple at the table sittin over to the right of where
You, your mom, and stepdad all were sittin
Their half-full coffee cups and a slapped down twenty on the table, Jackson-up
And the entry bell it tingled and the door slammed quickly shut
But before the door had banged the frame you thought you heard the bastard chuff
"Hey pretty lady, get in my truck; let's get Taco Bell and shake things up


Do you wanna skip the party and go get a Baja Blast?
Do you want a fancy dinner; is it really gonna last?
Do you want to get potatoes on that crunchy, cheesy wrap?
Do you wanna grab a pack of fire sauce out of my lap?
Hey pretty lady wanna get in my truck?
Let's get taco bell and shake things up

Twenty years of fire sauce'll mess your stomach up a bit
But you won't have a clue until it's inconvenient
So it went for these poor lovers then a score of years way on
Here's what happened once before the weekend
After date night every time, then came of course dessert
But older stomachs winds up getting sick and throwing up
Repeating the half backflips of that evening
Laughing through the bellyache when they got taco bell and shook things up

Do you wanna skip the party and go get a Baja Blast?
Do you want a fancy dinner; is it really gonna last?
Do you want potatoes on that crunchy, cheesy wrap?
Do you wanna grab a pack of fire sauce out of my lap?
Hey pretty lady wanna get in my truck?
Let's get taco bell and shake things up

Well the couple sittin in the booth on seventh on their golden anniversary
Didn't see it comin' in the least
When one got up to get another refill
and their phone up on the the table made a beep
Well the remaining lover glanced right down and saw the message
A pair of tits, emojis, and "hurry up and ditch 'em, babe, and make me fuckin' scream"

Do you wanna skip the party and go get a Baja Blast?
Do you want a fancy dinner; is it really gonna last?
Do you want to get potatoes on that crunchy, cheesy wrap?
Do you wanna grab a pack of fire sauce out of my lap?
Hey pretty lady wanna get in my truck?
Let's get taco bell and shake things up
