The Right Band

I tried to write a song with someone else's breath and my own words
But it came out incoherent, wrong, and slurred
And when I stood above her frame
All mangled, red and bare
I wondered if the struggle hadn't poisoned all the air

Set out all alone as free as free could be
Thinking glibly, "I'm gonna find the right band for me"
But she didn't see it coming
But she felt it on the breeze
The pallid, longing figure peeking in through blackened trees

Hey there take it easy
Hey, take it sitting down
It's not a thing that you or I can figure out right now
Life don't write in color
And Death don't make a sound
Replied the voice behind the bushes lying on the ground

And whether bad of good or proper then I leapt
Seeing all the world in sopping shades of red
The bottle dropped in unintended pieces
It was followed by the weight
Of fear and lust and longing for the artist on the take

Hey there take it easy
Hey, take it sitting down
It's not a thing that you or I can figure out right now
Life don't write in color
And Death don't make a sound
Replied the voice behind the bushes lying on the ground

Writing ain't so easy
But playin' ain't so hard
We said when we first met while making music in the yard
But life don't write in color
And death don't make a sound
The only sheriff here is entropy; you'd better write that down
