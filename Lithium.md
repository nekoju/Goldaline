# Lithium

I nearly shit myself again today
Add a gram and a half of lithium to the beers i had last night
What a choice to have to make
Soil my britches? Lose my mind?
Turns out functionality and continence are really quite in line
What's it mean to function anyway?
When the first and second orders of volition have orthogonal signs

Just try to make the best of it I can
But the calculus of misery isn't quite so cut and clean
What's worse for the body and the mind?
Fear and ennui, or to need to wash your jeans?
