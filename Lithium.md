# Lithium

I nearly shit myself again today
Add a gram and a half of lithium to the beers i had last night
What a choice to have to make
Soil my britches? Lose my mind?
Turns out functionality and continence are really quite in line

Just trying to make the best of it I can
But the calculus of misery isn't quite so cut and clean
What's worse? Self-sabatoge, or to need to wash your jeans?
