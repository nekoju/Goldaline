The Long Game

C                    F
I'm done playing the long game
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
I'm done shaking the dice on a prayer with a tailwind of breath
C                    F
I'm done with beauty
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
I'm done thinking the good guys get girls and the bad guys reflect on the faces staring back from their deaths
C                    F Sure enough I'm done dreaming C        F           Am2                  Am          D
Over amicable takings aways of those shitty events
C        F          (walk) Am7 Am C
Cause a stranger once said in a storm that the dreamers get wet

C                    F
I'm done taking the piss
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
There's nothing to say about anyone hasn't been said
C                    F
I'm done hustling pinball
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
Cause the tall stack of quarters I put under the leg just ain't making the numbers come out in the end
C                    F
I'm done taking the high road
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
Cause the high road's the one where it's raining on dreamers and ruining their delicate gifts
C        F          (walk) Am7 Am C
And the one where the lingering bandits run violentest grifts

F
And they'll say I tried
C
Or they'll say I didn't 
F, C, Am
Or they won't say anything at all cause they don't care
F
And I'll say I tried
C
Then I'll say I didn't
F, C, F, C
To occupy a bright and shining, muddy human sphere

C                    F
And I'm done making tiny changes
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
I'm done finding hope in the stump of a fallen off head
C                    F
I'm done with human condition
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
I'm done with the pitiable bastards with problems, who can't do their dishes or get out of bed
C                    F
And I'm done fighting the good fight
C        F           Am2                     Am          D
Done tearing the seams and aligning the things that don't fit
C        F          (walk) Am7 Am C
Cause the good fight's just me, going it all alone in my head

F
And they'll say I tried
C
Or they'll say I didn't try
F, C, Am
Or they won't say anything at all cause they don't care
F
And I'll say I tried
C
Then I'll say I didn't
F, C, F, C
To occupy a bright and shining, muddy human sphere

And the words that I'll say when I'm banished a "sinner" won't be with denial or pride, but a shrug
And when those dreams lead to the ground, the words on my grave, as they rot in the rain outside
"I tried"

F
And they'll say I tried
C
Or they'll say I didn't try
F, C, Am
Or they won't say anything at all cause they don't care
F
And I'll say I tried
C
Then I'll say I didn't
F, C, F, C
To occupy a world other than the one in which I'm living
