Pillar of salt

[Verse]
D                                           Em                      G
I tended a loamy mass of love and teeth and bile on the morning that you found me
        Em           G               D
But the soil's not as rich as it once was
                                         Em             G
The sallow branches of the carrot tops I planted in the garden now surround me
        Em           G   D
* Digging madly in the now depleted dust

[Break]

[Verse]
In my dream I was attending to the carrots and I saw you coming over
And when you came you brought a shovel and a tent
You started digging at the humus there beside me then later on the storm came
And you took shelter; I dug on and just got wet

[Verse]
    D                                             Em          G
The cracks and furrows in the bleached and rocky soil that I saw there in the morning
         Em            G                D
Formed a mirror in the grey fluorescent sun
        D                                               Em               G
Heat and light can grow a garden or can fake one from a distance And the glazing
                       Em         G                   D
and the dirt within my body fell out from the frame as one

[Chorus]
It's nobody's fault
That my plot's lying fallow and you don't see any vegetables growing
That I don't trust anyone any further than I can throw em
That I'm so goddamned concerned with what you think about me

[Verse]        
    D                            |Em             G                 |
Set everything aside you've ever listened to of Sodom and Gomorrah
            |Em              G                D
Recall what happened in the desert while they burned
          D                                 Em                     G
What's it mean to flee on foot from home on ultimatum in a hurry?
          Em      G                D
And what's the sin in Edith's momentary turn?

[Verse]
        G                                  Em                     G
Did she long to walk the footpaths of the gardens of her girlhood in the summer?
         Em            G             D
Did they even tell her why she had to leave?
                                                    Em             G
Who was she in human glory to find faith in former comfort when the Lord
            Em                G       D
in all his squalor told her what would be?

[Chorus]
    G          Bm
I'm turning to salt
          D                                  Em                      G
While I'm breaking my neck trying to catch a glimpse of your palaces burning
          D                Em                   Bm
While I'm feeling my shins solidifying into the earth and
          D                      Em          G
While I'm wondering if you still think about me

[Verse/Outro]
If you find the time to wander round the fertile crescent
Keep an eye out for the ground where nothing grows
In the absence of the life that grew before it
A sterile monument to Edith and her woe
