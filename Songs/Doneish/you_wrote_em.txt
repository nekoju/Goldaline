You Wrote 'Em
---

I'm struggling
To turn words into any kind of truth I can find anything to hang on
And I'm doing my best
To make thunderous nonsense reveal all my parts that I hate
And I've got no intention of learning anything I can bank on
But I'll be standing up here singing to anyone listening 'til late

Unholy Spirit
Move me to speak an unspeakable truth that somebody will heed
And Mother of loves lost and banished
Send cleverly planted ideas that will grow like a seed
If any among you can find any substance in the words that I say let me know
'Cause you wrote 'em

You wrote 'em
Didn't put 'em to paper but might just as well have held the pen
You wrote 'em
Didn't come out of your lips but your vacuum, it left me the wind
You didn't bloody your fingertips to save an unsavable rhyme
And you certainly didn't arrange them to match with the time
But you wrote 'em

I'm alone again
With the company of the cross I so eagerly carry to bleed on
And I'm pacing
Up and down the boulevard with pitiable paperboard signs
And you might not be able to read em from traffic and you might just keep keeping on
But you wrote 'em

You wrote 'em
Didn't put 'em to paper but might just as well have held the pen
You wrote 'em
Didn't come out of your lips but your vacuum, it left me the wind
You didn't bloody your fingertips to save an unsavable rhyme
And you certainly didn't arrange them to match with the time
But you wrote 'em

And if you're looking for meaning in the cobbled together sanctimonious shit that I write
Let me tell you right here and right now that I ain't got a clue
But you oughtta know out of anyone because..

You wrote 'em
Didn't put 'em to paper but might just as well have held the pen
You wrote 'em
Didn't come out of your lips but your vacuum, it left me the wind
You didn't bloody your fingertips to save an unsavable rhyme
And you certainly didn't arrange them to match with the time
But you wrote 'em
