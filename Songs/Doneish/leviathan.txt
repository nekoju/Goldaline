Leviathan (Formerly Ouroboros)

Em
There's an ebb and a flow and a tumult and a tow
   C
to fucking around and finding out
Em
A snake or whatevever metaphor you would use
C                                   Em/G
like a bullshit inlet to its spout
              G              C                Em       C
And there's a preacher whose sermon we're all suddenly learnin'
   Em/G        F#?         Em
is failing the test of the Mount

Em
But the time's coming soon when a place where the moon
            C
catches the balconies off the white house
    Em
the president's kid getting high on the stoop
C                                   Em/G
Thinks the country could use some improvin'
       G         C          Em        C
and he hires his son and he fires his hack 
        Em/G        F#?         Em
To plan our fortuitous doom

I'm not a prophet or philsopher, maybe nor a decent lay
But anyone who knows Can see the light that's coming up ain't the light of heaven but the lizard's busted gut
And to pick up where I put it down What's a human's lonely body
on on a bottle's fleshy frame?

When the faces and bodies melting out of the walls
In the torturous poses you put 'em in
And your kids' frightened cries at the sight of the flies
Pouring out of an open church bulletin
And they'll go for the throat of the man with the money
who's telling them who to despise.

I'm not a prophet or philsopher, maybe nor a decent lay
But anyone who knows Can see the light that's coming ain't the light of heaven but the lizard's busted gut
And to pick up where I put it down what's a human's body
On on a atom's fleshy frame?

[Bridge]

I'm not a prophet or philsopher, maybe nor a decent lay
But anyone who knows Can see the light that's coming up is the glow of burning bodies through lizard's busted gut
And to pick up where I put it down
Well God sure didn't complain
