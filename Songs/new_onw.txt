The nicotine-jaundicted ceiling in the diner on that vapid Friday night
Hung low enough to make you want to listen
To the couple at the table sittin over to the right of where
You, your mom, and stepdad all were sittin
Their half-full coffee cups and a slapped down twenty on the table, Jackson-up
And the entry bell it tingled and the door slammed quickly shut
But before the door had banged the frame you thought you heard the bastard chuff
"Hey pretty lady, get in my truck; let's get Taco Bell and shake things up

Twenty years of fire sauce'll mess your stomach up a bit
But you won't have a clue til you need it
So it went for these poor lovers a score of years way on
Eating every Friday; it was date night after all
After date night every time, came of course dessert
But older stomachs winds up getting sick and twisted up
Repeating the half backflips of their first romantic tryst
Laughing through the stomachache when they got taco bell and shook things up
