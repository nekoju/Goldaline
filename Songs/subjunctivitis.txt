(I had ChatGPT write this just to see what it came up with. Of course it's not very good but there might be some ideas)

(Verse 1)
In a world where dreams are spun,
Underneath the golden sun,
There's a condition, subtle and unseen,
In the heart, where hope has been.

(Chorus)
Oh, we're caught in a realm of what-ifs,
Living with this case of subjunctivitis,
Dreaming of places we've never been,
In the land of "could-have-been."

(Verse 2)
Close your eyes, feel the breeze,
Drift away, be at ease,
In the realm where dreams reside,
Where the heart takes a daring stride.

(Chorus)
Oh, we're caught in a realm of what-ifs,
Living with this case of subjunctivitis,
Dreaming of futures we could create,
In a world where dreams dictate.

(Bridge)
Castles in the air, we design,
In our minds, they brightly shine,
Reality shifts with every thought,
In this land, imagination's taught.

(Verse 3)
Build a bridge to the unknown,
Craft a path that's all our own,
In this kingdom, dreams come alive,
Where we thrive and truly thrive.

(Chorus)
Oh, we're caught in a realm of what-ifs,
Living with this case of subjunctivitis,
Dreaming of the beauty we can find,
In this world, imagination's bind.

(Outro)
So let's dance in the shades of might-be,
Embrace the dreams that set us free,
In the realm of endless flight,
We'll conquer the night with our light.
