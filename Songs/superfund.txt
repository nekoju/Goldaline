(V1)
What kind of shit did you have to step over to get to me?
Did you miss the tower of cans and stack of dirty magazines?
I can show you how I do it left to mine, my dear
And I'll get you home by ten if you don't want to stay here

(V2)
Check with the ranger at the gate
Get your name badge on your breast, affixed, and meet me at the lake
We call it that but really it's a settling pond
But it's full of life you'll never find by looking at it wrong

(Chorus)
I'm a barrel full of mercury darling
I'm an overflowing shitty lagoon
I'm a river full of hydrogen sulfide
I'm a picture of a smog-tinted moon
I'm a burning stack of tires at twilight
An impenetrable chlorine haze
A rusty barrel of ammonium nitrate
I'm a lazy beaurocratic delay

(V3)
What kind of nature do you expect to see?
You'll miss it if you look for something boring, lush, and green
I'll take you over to the fertilizer spill
where I take my lunches in the shade of the wrongly colored hill
The trees grow weird and crooked by the lake
With the animals deformed, and their uncountable legs
Do you see the puddle with its iridescent sheen?
Do you mind its iridescence beyond iridescency?

(Chorus)
I'm a barrel full of mercury darling
I'm an overflowing shitty lagoon
I'm a river full of hydrogen sulfide
I'm a picture of a smog-tinted moon
I'm a burning stack of tires at twilight
An impenetrable chlorine haze
A rusty barrel of ammonium nitrate
I'm a lazy beaurocratic delay
You'll find tadpoles in the languishing craters
And maybe the occasional frog
Just know that I'm a superfund baby
Remediate my landscape all night long

(Bridge)
Why build a fire in the woods?
Why pitch a tent inside a storm?
Come sit here by my crumbling cooling tower baby
I promise that you'll find it just as warm

(solo)

(Chorus)
I'm a barrel full of mercury darling
I'm an overflowing shitty lagoon
I'm a river full of hydrogen sulfide
I'm a picture of a smog-tinted moon
I'm a burning stack of tires at twilight
An impenetrable chlorine haze
A rusty barrel of ammonium nitrate
I'm a lazy beaurocratic delay
If you want to find some beauty you'll find it
Ecological succession is a powerful tool
And any patch of laurel you can find
It was rooted in the slurry before you

You'll find tadpoles in the languishing craters
And maybe the occasional frog
I know that I'm a superfund baby
I'll remediate my landscape when you're gone
