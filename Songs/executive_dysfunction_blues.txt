Executive Dysfunction Blues
--------------------

I've neglected the guitar in the corner all week
So it whines it's own resonant sob
"Where have you been and what you been doing?"
I say "just been doing my job"

There's a dusty old journal with really nice paper
I used to write in with clear fountain pens
Mostly stimming through squggles and scratches and nonsense
But the occasional gem reared its head

But then life got hard and I had shit to do
A job yes but mostly preoccupational dread
Over failures of then and then now and then soon
And I heard "Write that shit down 'fore you're dead."
