The hilltops rang with unsolicited concern
For what we didn't have and what we didn't earn
And an evening could not pass by without
More well-intentioned, ill-requested doubt

Lacking encouragement could not keep us apart
Darling what we had was lovely from the start
Their faithless will not harm us before
We pack our bags and swim forever more

Darling, westward we'll fly
from the East avert our eyes
While the others plan to flit and flutter south
To wash the consultatory spittle from their mouths

Turns out discouragement's encouraging my dear
we'll fly west again; our future will be clear
While the flock is now relaxing in the sun
We'll keep flying 'til our flying days are done

Pack your bags my bride
there's a bright and better life
There's a future bringing glorified despair
I see a bloody picket fence and I don't care

And played by everybody's rulebook but our own
And things could've turned out easier if we'd just read the fucking instruction page
But we never did it that way
But we were never playing the same game

The great circle that we chose it was a trip
It brought fun and trepidation, fear and grit
If I said "I wouldn't do it any other way", that'd be a lie
But navigation's aided by a clearing sky

We flew east and we flew west
I'm sure we really did our best
I guess that's all my soul needs for its weary eyes
Better, worse, or neutral, darling til we die
