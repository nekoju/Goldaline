Always gonna be lonely
Always gonna be sad
Always gonna be thinkin bout the things that I don't have

Always gonna clumsy
Always gonna be dumb
Always gonna always gonna write songs that rhyme too much to mean a fuck

Always gonna be sorry
Always gonna feel wrong
Always gonna wonder where I'll end up when I screw the fucking dog

Always gonna say I'm never
Gonna be as clever as my dad wanted me to be
but after all I'm doing better than the dice should say I be
so whatever quantum bullshit is or isn't happening in my brain
Fuck the expecatations... And oh yeah fuck the state

Fuck being lonely
Fuck being sad
Fuck wondering bout the opportunities I did or didn't have

Fuck feeling clumsy
Fuck feeling dumb
Fuck feeling like the words I write are dealing empty hands

Fuck being sorry
Fuck being wrong
Fuck all the condescending bastards who will never understand

Cuz I'm a multitude-containing
Absent-minded fucking klutz
And some of those vectors sure enough point elsewhere than but up
But wherever the bag of cold cuts leads me that ostensibly lays my fate
Fuck the expectations... And oh yeah fuck the state

Always gonna say I'm never
Gonna be as clever as my mom wanted me to be
but after all I'm doing better than the dice should say I be
so whatever quantum bullshit is or isn't happening in my brain
Fuck the expecatations... And while we're at it fuck the state
