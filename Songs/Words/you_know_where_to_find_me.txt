You know where to find me

[Verse]
When you told me you were leaving
I didn't see it coming
And furthermore I didn't see me sleeping in your bed that very night
But we made up

And in the morning after coffee
I felt at peace and even
And furthermore believing that our souls were meant to be and I should fucking lighten up
Cause we made up

And the second time you said it
I knew that it was meant
But now I'm looking at the birds behind the second contract on the second home we signed
Just right behind the second time you left and we made up

This morning after coffee
You said that you were leaving and you packed some shit and left
But I'll see you in the morning over coffee
In the meantime if you need me I'll be drinking in the shed

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm going to the bar again alone because if nothing else does that deserves a drink
Cause we made up again

[Chorus]
B, Am, G
B, F, D
B, Am, D
Oh my darling
You have nothing to fear
I'm a drunkard for your punishment my dear
and I'll be nursing on this bottle long into the night so if you care to find me just be sure and bring the beer

[Verse]
When you told me you were leaving
I knew it was a lie
And furthermore I didn't even have to question why you'd say it because that's really just the way things go these days
And of course we made up yet another time

And in the morning after coffee
I felt at peace and even
Though I knew that I was hurting, it was no one's fault but mine
But thankfully we're always making up

[Chorus]
Oh my darling
You have nothing to fear
I'm a drunkard for your punishment my dear
and I'll be nursing on this bottle long into the night so if you care to find me just be sure and bring the beer

[Bridge]
And I've done a lot of things that never needed doing
And I've dropped the ball a bit more than a little bit
But for for my back catalog of fuck-ups there's one that takes the cake
But in the end the biggest mistake wasn't making you hate me but convincing you you didn't

[Chorus]
Oh my darling
You have nothing to fear
I'm a drunkard for your punishment my dear
and I'll be nursing on this bottle long into the night so if you care to find me just be sure and bring the beer
