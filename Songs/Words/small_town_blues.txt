Small Town Blues


I've never seen the person at the bar
so I got carded for the first time in a year
But sometimes you just need to go
where no one knows your name

The lighting off the wall is unfamiliar
But the familiar's former comfort puts me off
Because having risks losing, my darling
The most valuable lesson you gave

Looking over your shoulder every time you go out
Ain't a way to exist if a world full of lovers and schmucks
And looking back over your questionable calls
Only takes the spirit so far into good before swallowing you up
And the next time our ships pass I'll honk and you'll plainly ignore it if I have the luck
But I'm starting to think that's just the small town blues

I wrote a hook and then I saw you in the crowd
inadvertently but dear that's only just so true
Glancing back now for the second time this minute cause I've always got an eye out
Is it the auspice of the city or just a relapse of the small town blues?

Looking over your shoulder every time you go out
Ain't a way to exist if a world full of lovers and schmucks
And looking back over your questionable calls
Only takes the spirit so far into good before swallowing you up
And the next time our ships pass I'll honk and you'll plainly ignore it if I have the luck
But I'm starting to think that's just the small town blues

I never really wanted to be petty, former lover
But I'm exhausted from gymnastics of assuming all the best
So I'm sorry if intruding here's a burden on your evening
But maybe y'all can find a bar without a stage so you can rest
Cause if the small town blues ain't writing decent music
I sure don't know the thing that fucking is

Looking over your shoulder every time you go out
Ain't a way to exist if a world full of lovers and schmucks
And looking back over your questionable calls
Only takes the spirit so far into good before swallowing you up
And the next time our ships pass I'll honk and you'll plainly ignore it if I have the luck
But I'm starting to think that's just the small town blues
