Ohio Goodbye

Darling it's just April but you're looking like Miranda July
And you're really hard to read but I think that I can see between the lines
But When evening came you left and doing little more than talking about the sky
I figured maybe I just read your spacing a little wider than I ought?
Or was that just an Ohio goodbye?

You started walking toward the door a couple months ago
But you stopped to get a drink along the way
And when you poured it you were looking like you'd would stick around a moment
You didn't wanna be there, but as much you wouldn't say
So you just sat there sipping rotten grapes

You said you liked the vintage brought to dinner Wednesday night
You were lying then or lying now but I'm not sure
But it doesn't matter anyhow cause you're now saying "it was fine"
But it was only when you slammed the door
That I recognized the Ohio Goodbye

So I'll close out and take an Irish Goodbye
