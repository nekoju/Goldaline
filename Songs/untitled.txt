I thought that you loved the parts of me that other people saw and waved away
And I thought that you reciprocated when I appreciated the unappreciable things in you
But What I thought, it didn't matter, cause I just kept on churnin' through
The frothy cold Atlantic part of you

I was a lover of God and you were a bully
You were a beacon of light and I was a rock
Not the kind you stand on when times get painful
But the kind that rends your frigid hull before the dock

The god that I gave myself to in that time
Whether bearer or light or of plague
