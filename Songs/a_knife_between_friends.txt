A knife between friends
-------------------

You came down and out
Not knowing where you'd be or what you'd be without
Being full of pity's quite a way to live
So of course I told you off the cuff to come on in

Up front, I'm a Jew
But just the funny kind you'd introduce your hippy mother to
So I was maybe just a little scared
When you started shouting, raving that I'd better be prepared
OK, well I guess now I'm "them"
After all, what's a knife between friends?

I feel it twisting in my chest
Kinda like a knife I guess but really not the same
Though I've never been run through I bet I'd choose
It over over risk triage for
Every other kindness I'll ever or could do
From a paring knife in the hall between rooms

What are words between lovers?
What's a knife between friends?
Why does nothing ever seem to start out like it ends?
What's a libelous roommate?
What's a murderous spouse?
They're really the same, less whose name's on the house
"What are we doing and why did we come?"
I asked him while putting my belt back on
What's a magistrate's summons? Subpeona? Affidavit?
Just irregular apathetic, atomic vibration 

Something like a spank bank for times you've almost been stabbed
You keep it in you head to interrupt you when you're glad
Wondering whether right to be unafraid or not
Or whether the long game of kindness is rot
What's the good in another temperate retreating
Left physically unscathed but humanity bleeding?

What are words between lovers?
What's a knife between friends?
Why does nothing ever seem to start out like it ends?
What's a libelous roommate?
What's a murderous spouse?
They're really the same, less whose name's on the house
"What are we doing and why did we come?"
I asked Lord Jehovah while cracking my gum
"What are feelings? What's betrayal? What makes someone a mother?"
"Just bags full of chemicals bumping into each other"
