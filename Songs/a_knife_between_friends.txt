A knife between friends
-------------------

Am, C, Am, C, G x2

You came down and out
Not knowing where you'd be or what you'd be without
Being full of pity's quite a way to live
So of course I told you off the cuff to come on in


Am, C, Am, C, G x2
Am, C, F Em (?) x2?

Up front, I'm a Jew
But just the funny kind you'd introduce your hippy mother to
So I was just a little scared
When you started shouting, raving that I'd better be prepared
OK, I'll leave; no one's ever called me "them"
Sister, after all, what's a knife between friends?

What are words between lovers?
What's a knife between friends?
Why does nothing ever seem to start out like it ends?
What's a libelous roommate?
What's a murderous spouse?
They're really the same, less whose name's on the house

Am, C, Am, C, G x2
Am, C, F Em (?) x2?

I feel it twisting in my chest
Kinda like a knife I guess but really not the same
Moral angst hits different
When the person in the mirror is a charlatan instead of who they claim
Maybe harder cause it's more deserving too?
From a knife in the hall between rooms

What are words between lovers?
What's a knife between friends?
Why does nothing ever seem to start out like it ends?
What's a libelous roommate?
What's a murderous spouse?
They're really the same, less whose name's on the house

"What are we doing and why did we come?"
I asked him while putting my belt back on
What's a magistrate's summons? Subpeona? Affidavit?
Just irregular apathetic, atomic vibration 
"What are we doing and why did we come?"
I asked Lord Jehovah while cracking my gum
"What are feelings? What's betrayal? What makes someone a mother?"
"Just bags full of chemicals bumping into each other"
