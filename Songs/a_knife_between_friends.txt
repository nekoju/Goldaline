A knife between friends
-------------------

Am, C, Am, C, G x2

Am hammers on d-e and b-c
C hammers on d-e

Am                               C
You came down and out
Am.                                       C.                          G
Not knowing where you'd be or what you'd be without
Am.                                                   C
Being full of pity's quite a way to live
Am.                                                            C.            G                  
So of course I told you off the cuff to come on in

Am, C, Am, C, F, Em

Am.                    C
Up front, I'm a Jew
Am.                                                              C.                                              G
Just the kind your mom would like and not the kind who runs the news
Am.                             C
So I was just a little scared
Am.                                 C.                                                G
When you started shouting, raving that I'd better be prepared
Am.                         F               Em                        
So I prepared and joined the rendezvous
Am.                        C.                                               G
Across the street up on the bank that sweaty August afternoon

Am.                   C.            F9( Cadd4)
What's a knife between friends?
Am.                                    C.              F9
What's a kindness to be done and what's a problem to preempt?
Am.                         C.                         F9
What's a person? Who's a problem?
Am.                                                       C.                                Fm.                     D
And why does the means deal the same stack of cards as the ends?

Am, C, Am, C, G x2
Am, C, F Em (?) x2?

I feel resentment twisting in my chest
Kinda like a knife I guess but doubtful it compares
Moral angst hits differently, beloved
When the person in the mirror is a shill who isn't buying her own wares

What's a knife between friends?
What's a kindness to be done and what's a problem to preempt?
What's a person? Who's a problem?
And when does the means deal the same stack of cards as the ends?

What is proximate violence?
What's a libelous roommate what's a murderous spouse?
The Clerk replied, "They're really just the same
except whose name is on the house"

"What are we doing and why did we come?"
I asked two enforcers of order (undone)
To the magistrate: "What is this thing, affidavit?"
"Just irregular apathetic, atomic vibration" 
I repeated before heaven "Why did I come?"
"What makes us blush and what makes us feel numb?"
"What hope? What's desolation? What makes someone a mother?"
"Just bags full of chemicals bumping into each other"
