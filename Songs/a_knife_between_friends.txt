A knife between friends
-------------------

You came down and out
Not knowing where you'd be or what you'd be without
Being full of pity's quite a way to live
So of course I told you off the cuff to come on in

Up front, I'm a Jew
But just the funny kind you'd introduce your hippy mother to
So I was maybe just a little scared
When you started shouting, raving that I'd better be prepared
OK, well I guess now I'm "them"
After all, what's a knife between friends?
