Ouroboros

We live in and ebb and an tumult and flow
Of fucking around and finding out
A snake or whatevever metaphor you would use
Like a bullshit inlet to its spout
Or a pulpit that fails at the Mount
Or a wormhole a singular inconceivable point
With a singular inconceivable point

But the time's coming soon when the place where the moon
catches the balconies off the white house
while the president's kid smokes a joint
and he convinces his dad maybe crypto is back
and he hires his son and he fires the hack who was
Managing, wrangling, hemming the money
and now suddenly everyone's dead

I'm not a prophet or philsopher, maybe nor a decent lay
About the latter part I'll circle back; I've been around a bit
But when it comes to seeing what's ahead, anyone who's worth their shit
Can see the light that's coming up
Ain't the light of heaven but the lizard's [I hate it snakes aren't lizards but I love it poetically] busted gut
And to pick up where I put it down
What's a human's lonely body on on a bottle's fleshy frame?

When the faces and bodies melting out of the walls
In the torturous poses you put 'em in
And your kids' frightened cries at the sight of the flies
Coming out of the eyes of the lady who wrote the church bulletin
Overtake them with rage later on in their days
And they come for religion and sharpen their knives
And they'll go for the throat of the man with the money telling them who they should hate.

I'm not a prophet or philsopher, maybe nor a decent lay
About the latter part I'll circle back; I've been around a bit
But when it comes to seeing what's ahead, anyone who's worth their shit
Can see the light that's coming up
Ain't the light of heaven but the [lizard's *I hate it but I love it] busted gut
And to pick up where I put it down
What's a human's body on on a atom's fleshy frame?

The feet and the eyes looking back from the walls
Coming up sliding past on the right
Look familiar cause you've seen 'em before in the mirror
But to get to the mirror you look into tonight
Each morning, the silver and twilight, the black
But this evening beloved,
the mirror's the color of blight

I'm not a prophet or philsopher, maybe nor a decent lay
About the latter part I'll circle back; I've been around a bit
But when it comes to seeing what's ahead, anyone who's worth their shit
Can see the light that's coming up
Ain't the light of heaven but the [lizard's *I hate it but I love it] busted gut
And to pick up where I put it down
Well God sure didn't complain
