ACAB

I went to church and daily said my prayers
I went to school and really tried for years
But for all my childish folly I was certain of a phrase
and it sounded quite a bit like "Jesus Saves"

A little older, little wiser, I went on
I learned religion is preposterous and wrong
I learned to cycle, pay my bills, but not the cost of dying on my hills
Because the ravens always ate the vultures gliding on

I know that ____ cool but talking too much isn't
I know that institutions rule our lives and make us do the dishes
But the only think I really know is who is friend and who is foe
And I got a lot of figuring on those bitches

But I'm ignorant
Less ignorant than yesterday maybe
But less the complement of infinity's still naught
And I'm one of an incalculable pool of wildly variable transducers of karmic energy hurtling toward the sun
And you expect that I should know what's fucking what?

Now I know that loathing, bile, and wrath are human
But so are all the motherfuckers that I loathe
I know the planet and the forest both are bastards
Don't get me started on the ones with navy souls
But like a flower ain't a flower missing phosphorus and sun
A bastard ain't a bastard on his own
