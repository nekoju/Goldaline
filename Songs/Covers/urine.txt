[Verse 1]

D
I swear that someday
A
I'll tell you without lying
      Bm
I was born to quit smoking
      G
I was born to quit dying

[Verse 2]
        D
On that day, not doing heroin
A
Will be easy as piss
            Bm
And on that day I'll stop talking so much
G
shit about the government

[Chorus]
D                               A
'Cause urine speaks louder than words
               Bm
On a politician
                     G
Or on a prison warden
Urine speaks louder than words

[Verse 3]
D
I swear that today
      A
I was born to be living!
      Bm
I was born to be singing!
      G
I was born to be fighting

[Verse 4]
                  D
But will somebody say
                   A
Is this resistance or a costume party?
Bm
Either way I think black
     G
with bandanas is a boring theme
 
[Verse 5]
D
I don't gotta tell ya
A
Crackers are great with amnesia
Bm
When they wanna forget something like
G
Centuries of racism

[Verse 6]
D
They say look at the man
          A
On center stage and pay no attention
Bm
While millions get locked in a cage
G
Riots break out in Oakland

[Chorus]
D                               A
'Cause urine speaks louder than words
               Bm
On a prison warden
                      G
Or on a Bart policeman
Urine speaks louder than words
