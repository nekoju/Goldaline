Harm Reduction

Woke up with deep thrombosis of the soul
Cause the dungarees I bought were sewn with dirty needles
somewhere off in Bangladesh I've never been but sure enough will safely say
Isn't half as nice as Gary, Indiana
But I got 'em two-for-twenty and if I'm being honest I like it that way

The doctor said I had to cut it out
Cause the infection's spread and I'm not getting any better
So I'm standing at the counter in a place I've never been to get a vial
Colored amber like the liquid in the bottle
And if I'm really being honest that just kinda makes me smile
