Walking across the sand in Delaware picking up jellyfish and throwing em high as I could
And that's the the only memory of the beach with you that qualifies as good

And then another weekend traveled North to see the mines where greed kept on burning underneath
And made the limestone glow send that toxic light into the sky for one surreally dim illuminated week
Just like burners put to human bone, fragments of his foot, their hand, her cheek 
The cliffs burned red like graphite for a moment and my father's broken frame crumbled further; bone to leaves 

leaves to dust

dust to spirit
