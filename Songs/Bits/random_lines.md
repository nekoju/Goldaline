I'm sorry for my various acids
I'm sorry for my various bases
I'm sorry I can't save enough money to take you special places
I'm sorry I'm an asshole sometimes
I'm sorry for just saying that I'm trying
But I'm really fucking trying

Kindly disregard the words I inside of you
Your body or your soul the choice is yours

Kindly disregard the words I inside of you
Your body or your soul the choice is yours

But my tape deck is broken, maybe a mile ahead there's a light
The high road's awful lonely this time of night
