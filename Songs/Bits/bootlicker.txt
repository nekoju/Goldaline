Bootlicker

I used to be kind of bootlicker
But then I realized the folks who were making the rules were all dumber than me
And I used to be scared of my teachers
But I realized they were all just as afraid of not knowing as I was of being
And I used to laugh at silly words I remembered when I was supposed to be reading
And got slapped in the face so I put lauging on hold til the spring
