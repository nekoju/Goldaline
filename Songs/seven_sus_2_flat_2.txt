Well wouldn't you know it; it went just as planned
I was making it, faking it whatever
And the sun it turned dark for a minute when my future didn't go as I'd planned
So I squirmed and I bristled and I slipped through the cracks
And I landed with a bruise on my ass

The another few years I was making it, faking it again
And carried a shiny new definition of sin
And I skittered and scurried and dodged and I weaved
And I outpaced the behemoth within
And I entered an endless crevasse

If you're comin up upon a key change
That you're just not feelin in your mind
and now you know what you gotta do
Just give it a 6sus2b2 four-seventh and I bet it'll come out just fine

Well another few years and a couple of bruises before
I'd thought differently, better
Often enamored of the world lay before
But now I'm indifferently hating and it only gets worse
And I'm stuck in a bridge that's perpetually hung up on a fourth

If you're comin up upon a key change
That you're just not feelin in your mind
and now you know what you gotta do
Just give it a 6sus2b2 four-seventh and I bet it'll come out just fine
