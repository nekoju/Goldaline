You Wrote 'Em
---

    G
I'm struggling
        Em                     C                            G
To turn words into any kind of truth I can find anything to hang on
        Em                               C                           G
to make thunderous nonsense show all the parts of that myself that I hate
         Em                  C                       G
And I've got no intention of learning anything I can bank on
            Em               C                                G       G/F#
But I'll be standing up here singing to anyone listening 'til late

    G
Mother of loves lost and banished
        Em                     C                            G
Move me to sing an unspeakable truth that someone'll heed
        Em                     C                            G
Send cleverly planted ideas that will grow like a seed
        Em                     C                            G
If any among you can find any substance in any of the words that I say
            Em               C                                G       G/F#
You wrote 'em

[Chorus]
    Em           C
You wrote 'em
                  G                                 D        Em
Didn't put 'em to paper but might just as well have held the pen
     C
(You wrote 'em)
                        G                        D           Em
Didn't come out of your lips but your vacuum, it left me the wind
                C
(You wrote 'em)
           G                                 D         Em
You didn't bloody your fingertips to save an unsavable rhyme
                 C
(You wrote 'em)
                  G                         D            Em
And you certainly didn't arrange them to match with the time
               C   G D
(You wrote 'em)
        Em        C G G/G#
But you wrote 'em

[Verse 3]
    G
I'm alone here again 
         Em                                C        G
With the company of the cross I so eagerly carry to bleed on
        Em                                 C          G
And I'm pacing the boulevard with pitiable paperboard signs
                  Em           C                G                G/F#
Even if you can't read em from traffic and even if you just keep keeping on
    G         C G G/F#
You wrote 'em

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
              C                          G                Em                        D
And if you're looking for meaning in the cobbled together sanctimonious shit that I bray
        C                            G                      D
Let me tell you right here and right now that I ain't got a clue

[Chorus]
