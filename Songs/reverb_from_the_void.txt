Reverb from the Void
-------

Your mom and my dad they would fight and we'd go to our rooms
To deal each in our very own ways with our heartache and gloom
I turned to my silverfaced fender and old beverly hills
You turned to a razor and bottles of liquor and pills

Twenty and something years later and two lives removed
We met at a club out of boise one late afternoon
Well i was there playin and you were there drinking that night
And the goddess herself could't book a more marketable fight

Well the screamin and shoutin did raise up a hell of a din
And the sheriff was called to attend to the noises within
But the cosmos won't hear about yours or my sorrow or joy
And it rang through the tavern door like reverb from the void

Another ten years and a couple of marriages on
I kept to myself playing shows around town until dawn
Another two visits to rehab and you
Dealt in subtly different ways with your heartache and gloom

We still never talked much but knew just as much as we cared
About yours and my comings and goings and our spotty affairs
But you didn't know what I did to recover my heart
After serially failing to keep my bright future from falling apart

Given an eon our parents would never pay mind
To the notes of their golden boy's fall from that wonderful high
But I did it one Saturday in South Illinois
And the gunshot rang out like reverb from the void

(Spoken-ish?)
God clicked off the standby played an (ostensibly) heavenly chord
The cowering field mice of the 
festival dropped their heads and shouted, "spare us Lord!"
They scittered and they tangled with the dissonance behind
When the root has faded to a hum they still sat crouching scared and deaf and blind
They asked aloud "our heavenly host please spare us from that sound"
But the sixty cycle hum went on, oblivious and proud
The lead's indifferece to the frightened pups' anxiety and loss
To say the least of epidemic rodent parasitic holocausts
So it is with us for every unforseen disaster
We should maybe just appreciate that god just likes old telecasters?
