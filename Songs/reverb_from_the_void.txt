Your mom and my dad they would fight and we'd go to our rooms
To deal each in our very own ways with our heartache and gloom
I turned to my silverfaced fender and old beverly hills
You turned to a razor and bottles of liquor and pills

Twenty and something years later and two lives removed
We met at a club out of boise one late afternoon
Well i was there playin and you were there drinking that night
And the goddess herself could't book a more marketable fight

Well the screamin and shoutin did raise up a hell of a din
And the sheriff was called to attend to the noises within
But the cosmos won't hear about yours or my sorrow or joy
And it rang through the tavern door like reverb from the void


God clicked off the standby played an (ostensibly) heavenly chord
The cowering field mice of the 
festival dropped their heads and shouted, "spare us Lord!"
They scittered and they tangled with the dissonance behind
When the root has faded to a hum they still sat crouching deaf and blind
They asked aloud "our heavenly host please spare us from that sound"
But the sixty cycle hum went on, oblivious and proud
The lead's indifferece to the poor mouse pups' anxiety and loss
To say the least of epidemic rodent parasitic holocausts
So it is with us for every unforseen disaster
We should maybe just appreciate that god just likes old telecasters?
