Mean Girl

In which I tell you what you are and why I care
An icon of good etiquette and flair
In which the only opener that I have is that
"I really like your hair"

In which way you work a crowd of four
And your fire lights the pathway to the door
In which I trample all the bodies in the way
And I leave just two beers deep but justly swaying

And I know that you won't ever wanna hear it
But that body's only got another mean girl's spirit
And those lovely ears don't wanna listen innit?
Cause you're just a really well-attired infant

In pixelated photos of the present and the past
Beset by hearts and care reacts and lolz
The well-appointed mean girls of the future
Manifesting that which leads to idiot's gold

And I know that you won't ever wanna hear it
But that body's only got another mean girl's spirit
And those lovely ears don't wanna listen innit?
Cause you're just a really well-attired infant

Well I'm sure you had a laugh or two on my account
I know that I say shit and no one cares
But I'll still steal a conversation on a dime without a fucking clue
And wouldn't ya know it babe, you're still a mean girl

And I know that you won't ever wanna hear it
But that body's only got another mean girl's spirit
And if I infantilize you just this very instant
Apologies my darling; you're just a really fucking well-attired infant
