I Am

I'm the one who gets invited to parties
Because I know the right people and say stupid shit
I'm the one who is taking your picture
So you and the ones who came with you are all gonna fit

The ones who have given you permanence of objects
The parlance of our time calls them friends
Maybe they do stuff together or maybe they don't
I don't really know in the end

But if you're meeting a couple or two of em for lunch
Just give me a call and I'll come running quick
Take your photo and say some of that dumb shit I'm known for
I'll leave, and you'll get on talking shit
