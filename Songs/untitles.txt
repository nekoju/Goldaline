Gnarled fingers push phosphor bronze to stainless steel
Another tenuous rhyme comes to mind and I include it here against my will
Didn't tune it; didn't care; crooked harmonies wobble like an out-of-balance carriage wheel
For what's the good in writing if we regulate what's writ?
And what's the good in musing if the muse chewed off your fingertips?

I lay awake fretting over everthing I never did
And wondering if I've kept my darkest secrets hid
sufficiently from any eyes that pry or keep account of what I did


What's a dozen crimson roses lying on the floor?
Is it a portent or a trace of what occupied that space before?
