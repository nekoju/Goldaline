The living room walls turned quietly to quarried stone
And the house I thought I occupied turned inside out and sent me out alone
To wander through the wilderness, sucking marrow out of cracked and splintered, bleached out bones
And now I see the city walls instead, towering high above the gilded thrones
Of everyone I thought I knew, and everyone who felt like home

Gnarled fingers fused to stubby nails push phosphor bronze to stainless steel
Another tenuous rhyme comes to mind and I include it here against my will
Didn't tune it; didn't care; crooked harmonies wobble like an out-of-balance carriage wheel
Pushing songs to bars like carts of melons to the city gate
Hoping that I'll maybe be let in one day to sell my wares but not regain my place

Ain't no coronation
Ain't no clamoring throng

For what's the good in writing if we regulate what's writ?
And what's the good in musing if the muse chewed off your fingertips?
