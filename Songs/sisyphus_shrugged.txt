Sisyphus Shrugged
---

Do you feel the global weight put on your shoulders?
Does it satisfy that very human urge
To be better, to contribute, to be stronger?
Is your triumphant sonata really just a dirge?

Is the weight that you're so proud of just a boulder?
Bound to roll and crush your oh-so-well-laid plans?
Who will bail you out of holding in the morning?
Who will even want to try to understand?
