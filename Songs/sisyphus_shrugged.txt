Sisyphus Shrugged
---

Do you feel the global weight put on your shoulders?
Does it satisfy that very human urge
To be better, to contribute, to be stronger?
Is your triumphant marching chorus just a dirge?

Is the weight that you're so proud of just a boulder?
Bound to roll and crush your oh-so-well-laid plans?
When the market rends your bootstraps in the morning
Who will even want to try to understand?

Who will bail you out of holding in the morning?
Who will pay to feed your kids their fancy treats?
Who will listen when you're falling on the pavement?
Turns out broken glass ain't such a little thing if you just aren't wearing shoes.
