Let's make a building
A burning bush of Babels intertwined
Let's make the dust of our friction to mortar
Let's make the blood of our crying to vines
Let's build a build a ballista
As it sinks in to the bastard in the sky
Jerusalem will dance again
When the man at the desk and the boss above him
Crumble into a granular pile
