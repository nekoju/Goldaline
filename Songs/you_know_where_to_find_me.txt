You know where to find me

[Verse]
When you told me you were leaving
I didn't see it coming
And furthermore I didn't see me sleeping in your bed that very night
But we made up

And in the morning after coffee
I felt at peace and even
And furthermore believing that our souls were meant to be and I should fucking lighten up
Cause we made up

And the second time you said it
I knew that it was meant
But now I'm looking at the birds behind the second contract that we signed together
Just right behind the second time you left

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm going to the bar again alone because if nothing else does that deserves a drink
Cause we made up again

[Chorus]
Oh my darling
You have nothing to fear
I'm a drunkard for your punishment my dear
and I'll be nursing on this bottle long into the night so if you care to find me just be sure and bring the beer

[Verse]
When you told me you were leaving
I knew it was a lie
And furthermore I didn't even have to question why
And of course we made up yet another time

And in the morning after coffee
I felt at peace and even
Though I knew that I was hurting, it was no one's fault but mine
But thankfully we are always making up

And I'm going to the bar again alone because if nothing else does that deserves a drink
So pull a stool on up and tell me what you think

[Chorus]
Oh my darling
You have nothing to fear
I'm a drunkard for your punishment my dear
and I'll be nursing on this bottle long into the night so if you care to find me just be sure and bring the beer

[Bridge]
This morning after coffee
You said that you were leaving and you packed some shit and left
But I'll see you in the morning over coffee
We'll hug it out and I'll do better like I said
In the meantime if you need me I'll be drinking in the shed

[Chorus]
Oh my darling
You have nothing to fear
I'm a drunkard for your punishment my dear
and I'll be nursing on this bottle long into the night so if you care to find me just be sure and bring the beer
