title: "Polly and Marie"
---

Polly dated Christine
And Marie slept with Dan
But it didn't leave a goddamn speck of time for sunsets and holding hands
So to make right sure that they both got what they were needin
they sat and planted up a hell of a plan

Well Tuesdays Chris and Polly would go to a dinner play
Except for the first cuz of Chris and Dan's therapy
And the first and third Thursdays Marie wouldn't make plans
Cuz Polly had to get to line dancing with Dan

So they set it to simplify and drafted a lil beaurocracy
