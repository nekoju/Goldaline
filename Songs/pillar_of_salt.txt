# Experiment with D/A

Pillar of salt

D                                           Em          G
I tended a loamy mass of love and teeth and bile on the morning that you found me
        Em           G               D
But the soil's not as rich as it once was
                                         Em             G
The sallow branches of the carrot tops I planted in the garden now surround me
        Em           G   D
Digging madly in the now depleted dust

Set everything aside you've ever listened to of Sodom and Gomorrah
Recall what happened in the desert while they burned
What's it mean to flee from home on ultimatum in a hurry?
And where's the harm in Edith's momentary turn?

    G          Bm
I'm turning to salt
          D                                  Em                      G
While I'm breaking my neck trying to catch a glimpse of your palaces burning
          D                Em                   Bm
While I'm feeling my shins solidifying into the earth and
          D                      Em          G
While I'm wondering if you still think about me


In my dream I was attending to the carrots and I saw you coming over
And when you came you brought a shovel and a tent
You started digging at the humus there beside me then later on the storm came
And you took shelter; I dug on and just got wet

The clouds had moved, you took your leave, the sun was beating
And I stood there with my spade and looked around
The trampled ash that had at once been fertile soil in the evening
Was a hard and lonely patch of hellish ground

It's nobody's fault
That my plot's lying fallow and you don't see any vegetables growing
That I don't trust anyone any further than I can throw em
That I'm so goddamned concerned with what you think about me
?
That .... Write something
That .... Write something
when I wonder if you gave a shit about me
