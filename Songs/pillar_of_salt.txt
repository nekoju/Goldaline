Pillar of salt

D                                           Em                      G
I tended a loamy mass of love and teeth and bile on the morning that you found me
        Em           G               D
But the soil's not as rich as it once was
                                         Em             G
The sallow branches of the carrot tops I planted in the garden now surround me
        Em           G   D
* Digging madly in the now depleted dust

In my dream I was attending to the carrots and I saw you coming over
And when you came you brought a shovel and a tent
You started digging at the humus there beside me then later on the storm came
And you took shelter; I dug on and just got wet

    D                                             Em          G
The cracks and furrows in the bleached and rocky soil in the morning
         Em            G                D
Formed a mirror in the grey fluorescent sun
        D                                Em                      G
Heat and light can grow a garden or can fake one from a distance And the glazing
       Em         G                   D
and my body fell out from the frame as one

It's nobody's fault
That my plot's lying fallow and you don't see any vegetables growing
That I don't trust anyone any further than I can throw em
That I'm so goddamned concerned with what you think about me
?
That .... Write something
That .... Write something

    D                                            Em                G
Set everything aside you've ever listened to of Sodom and Gomorrah
Recall what happened in the desert while they burned
          D                         Em                     G
What's it mean to flee on foot from home on ultimatum in a hurry?
          Em      G                D
What's the sin in Edith's momentary turn?

Did she long to walk the gardens of her girlhood in the summer?
Did they even tell her why she had to leave?
Who was she in human glory to find faith in former comfort
When God in all his squalor told her what will be?

If you find opportunity to wander round the fertile crescent
Keep an eye out for the ground where nothing grows
In the absence of the plants that grew before it
A sterile monument to Edith and her woe 

    G          Bm
I'm turning to salt
          D                                  Em                      G
While I'm breaking my neck trying to catch a glimpse of your palaces burning
          D                Em                   Bm
While I'm feeling my shins solidifying into the earth and
          D                      Em          G
While I'm wondering if you still think about me
