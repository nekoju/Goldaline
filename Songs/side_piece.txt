Side Piece

[Verse]

C, G, C, F, C, G, C
Well your life is too in order and it could use some fucking up. Just shoot a text and I'll be happy to oblige
C, G, C, F, C, G, C
If the one you're cuddlin' up to isn't giving any up well that's too bad but I can warm you up tonight
F, C, G, C
As long it's it's ok with him or her or it or they I'm on the phone and I'll be waiting here alright
F, C, G, C
To drive on up this evening and deliver what you need cuz I'm your side piece

C, G, C, F, C, G, C
So you've got some things in place and it's all working how you wanted and you need to see the light to lift you up
C, G, C, F, C, G, C
Keep believin if you want you've got it sorted but you've only built an artifice of meat and cum and blood
F, C, G, C
If you meet me at the notary I'll sign the x and then we'll be off and having fun
F, C, G, C
But just be up front and center if what you're really looking for's a side piece

Dm, F, C, G
Well do you want another someone who is really good in bed and won't impose upon you anything you couldn't otherwise have planned?
Dm, F, C, G
Do you want someone who's mad enough to have a little fun but won't talk shit when you get bored or overwhelmed and cut and run? 
Dm, F, C, G
Someone who's a looker and will turn a couple heads? And someone you can ditch and they'll just take it on the chin 
F, C, G, C
If the thing who checks your boxes matches all of the above
F, C, G, C
You're not looking for a lover darlin what you're really looking for's a side piece

So you got a healthy life and it could use some fucking up. You're well adjusted so I'm sure you'll manage fine.
If the one you're cuddlin' up to in the evening isn't giving any up then I'm certain that the problem isn't on the other line
As long it's it's ok with him or her or it or they just send me packing with the shit from on my desk and never mind
You're absolved and you don't owe a fucking thing cuz I'm your side piece

To the vulturous middle management you live in and breathe
Take a page from your planner; remember the day like the first
you first heard about Christ and the king and the thief
And were pointed the door marked in scarlet to sin and to Earth
While you were altered, called your friends in the evening 
Eating flesh; drinking blood with your purity rings
The ones who you vote for won't do any better at night
While you're measuring the weight of your choices by day

Well do you want another someone who is really good in bed and won't impose upon you anything you couldn't otherwise have planned?
Do you want someone who's mad enough to go and have a little fun but won't talk shit when you get bored or overwhelmed and cut and run? 
Someone who's a looker and will turn a couple heads?
And someone you can ditch and they'll just take it on the chin 
Just let me grab an application from the person at the desk
And I'll fill it out in pink and I'll submit it and I'll call them back on Monday cuz I really really really really really wanna be
Your only side piece
