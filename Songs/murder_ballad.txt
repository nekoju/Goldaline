I wasn't shit out with these tattoos on my arms but they're my birthright all the same
Came out all wet and bloody; my little face was just as stoic as could be
But my mother didn't hold me and she didn't even cry
Cause I tore the bitch in half and then she died

Me and dad packed up and left for Detroit to pursue a better life but then he died
I received my happy quarters with a clerically distinguished dad and wife
But she caught him hailing fairest Mary from the prayer team
So she hit him with an iron and he died

So I found a better way to make a living and it was a better life
I saw this silver spoon investor and with a black and crimson pinstripe suit
I shot the motherfucker down and then he died
