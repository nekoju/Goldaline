Pillar of salt

D                                           Em          G
I tended a loamy mass of love and teeth and bile on the morning that you found me
        Em           G               D
But the soils not as rich as it once was
                                         Em             G
The sallow branches of the carrot tops I planted in the garden now surround me
        Em           G   D
Digging madly in the now depleted dust

D                                       Em           G                                      
I wrote a hook and then I saw you at a show that very August evening
Em                                 G       D
inadvertently but dear that's only just so true
              Em          G
Glancing back now for the second time this minute cause I've always got an eye out
          Em                  G                                 D
Is it the auspice of the city or is it just a relapse of the small town blues?

    G          Bm
I'm turning to salt
          D                                  Em                      G
While I'm breaking my neck trying to catch a glimpse of your palaces burning
          D                Em                   Bm
While I'm feeling my shins solidifying into the earth and
          D                      Em          G
While I'm wondering if you still think about me
