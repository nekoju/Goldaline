"Polly and Marie"

The couple at hand had just met in the crowd 
At a festival out by the sea
And things escalated and they went where they went
And they stuffed fancy things a calligrapher made
Into envelopes in a rug on their knees
Ivory paper from France and a ribbon
Longwinded words from a credible pen
And a picture of the new brides to be
And in red ink and gold foil at the bottom
"Polly and Marie"

A dozen years on their eyes wandered
But they knew of the human affair
So the sat and decided together one evening
Without furtherly putting it off
That the rule'd be to simply not care
Who slept with whom and where and what room
And what's to know a body in the biblical sense
So they set out as if on a dare
To let all of their circles and everyone else
Open season arrived on the pair

With a tap and a swipe they were off
Stumbling home after nights about town with another
And everything was fine, everything was ok
Until someday when everything wasn't


Polly dated Christine
And Marie slept with Dan
But it didn't leave a goddamn speck of time for sunsets and holding hands
So to make right sure that they both got what they were needin
they sat and planted up a hell of a plan

Well Tuesdays Chris and Polly would go to a dinner play
Except for the first cuz of Chris and Dan's therapy
And the first and third Thursdays Marie wouldn't make plans
Cuz Polly had to get to line dancing with Dan

So they set it to simplify and drafted a lil beaurocracy
