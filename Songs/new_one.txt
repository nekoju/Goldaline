Always gonna be lonely
Always gonna be sad
Always gonna be thinkin bout the things that I don't have

Always gonna clumsy
Always gonna be dumb
Always gonna always gonna write songs that rhyme too much to mean a fuck

Always gonna be sorry
Always gonna feel wrong
Always gonna wonder where I'll end up when I screw the fucking dog

Always gonna say I'm never
Gonna be as clever
as my mom wanted to be
but I'm doing better than the dice should say I be
so whatever quantum bullshit is or isn't happening in my brain
Fuck the expecatations... And oh yeah fuck the state
