Not the point 

You're the kind whose takeaway from Kafka's only "I would be a better engineer"
The kind who gazes at a group of humans but winds up seeing only gears
And you're the kind who organizes everything and everyone I love
For voting! Discourse! Politicking! Fire from above!

You're the kind who understands the twinkle in the politician's eye
When he's talking bout redistricting and which mayor to annoint
And you might sneer at what he's saying while he talks into the crowd
But it's the mechanism darlin; the message ain't the point

[Chorus]
If you're thinking of putting people through a grinder made for meat
Let me caution you against that course of action
If you're thinking now instead of buying some other built machine
You'll be disappointed in the morning when it comes
When the driver leaves you'll tip her and you'll feel a little better
But when you look inside you'll find it's just a different-painted version of the other one

So if I catch you by the water cooler, baby
I can smile with the best of 'em and fake talkin' bout the game
But if talking to another person there and then is what you're needin'
I've molted to a politician; sorry bout the sudden change

[Chorus]
If you're thinking of putting people through a grinder made for meat
Let me caution you against that course of action
If you're thinking now instead of buying some other built machine
You'll be disappointed in the morning when it comes
When the driver leaves you'll tip her and you'll feel a little better
But when you look inside you'll find it's just a different-painted version of the other one
[Post-chorus]
If you say "coalition" one more time I swear I'm done
