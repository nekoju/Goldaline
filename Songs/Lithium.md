# Lithium

I nearly shit myself again today
Add a gram and a half of lithium to the beers i had last night
What a choice to have the circumstance to make
Turns out functionality and continence are really quite in line
What's it mean to function anyway?
When the first and second orders of volition are mismatched have opposing signs

Just try to make the best of it I can
But the calculus of misery isn't quite so cut and clean
What's worse for the body and the spirit?
Fear and ennui, or to need to wash your jeans?
Well the britches pay the bills so I'll just keep on keepin on
And when the pharmacist says "any questions?" I'll say "no" and then I'll leave

A blood test in the morning and a check-in with the doc
She asks me if it's working and I say it's kinda hard to tell
My nights have fucked me up and my mornings let me down
I've lost the signal in the noise of quarried limestone hell
Eating less and drinking more's sure not what she'd advise
But drinking's the best way I got of keeping grand ambition well in line
