 I wrote a hook and then I saw you standing in the crowd
 inadvertently but dear that's only just so true
 Glancing back now for the second time this minute cause I've always got an eye out
 Is it the auspice of the city or is it just a relapse of the small town blues?

Turf war
Karma loop
Speak in knowing glances
