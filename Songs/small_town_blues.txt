 D                                                 Em              G                                      
 I wrote a hook and then I saw you standing in the crowd that very evening
 Em                                 G       D
 inadvertently but dear that's only just so true
               Em          G
 Glancing back now for the second time this minute cause I've always got an eye out
           Em                                  G                         D
 Is it the auspice of the city or is it just a relapse of the small town blues?
