# Check engine

[Verse]
The blood between the gears is running dry
The hollow purpose that you've written's Coagulated in the lines
Each broken rung of chainlink dryly galling out the cogs
To put a point on it, we're shitting on the job

[Verse]
The sweating bosses see the lube is drying up
"Poke their asses get them wetter they're not working fast enough"
fluorescent meathooks run us through, paper gimp suit with a grin
To put a point on it we're swimming in their sin

[Chorus]
Cause the car we're driving's got a wobbly frame of bones
And a radiator filled with tears, gasping at the fumes of hope
And it's tremoring and barking, pull over while there's time
Keep your nuts on babe we're going for a ride

[Bridge]
Have you ever seen a starving engine seize?
Do you wonder what will happen when this motor burns its grease?
Will it make its own, and round and round?
That's what the story says
Maybe so, but if the whole thing goes,
the pistons get off easy and the block, it winds up dead

[Verse]
studs and leather tight against your milky thighs
And a wooden X to mark the spot she'll flay your bratty hide
ain't got nothing on some handsome tweed and a car key with a fob
To put a point on it, you're fucking your own job

[Chorus]
The car we're driving's got a wobbly frame of bones
And radiator filled with tears, gasping at the fumes of hope
And no little felted pine tree's gonna cover up the smell
There's bodies in the trunk and we're all driving straight to hell
... ... ...
Cause no one got the memo they've been sold a happy lie
And the workers work efficiently until their babies die
Then no amount of corporate polo shirts will soothe their bloodshot eyes
Keep your nuts on babe we're going for a ride
