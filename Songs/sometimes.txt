Sometimes

Sometimes you need a friend who you can talk about your tits to
Sometimes you really just need one who understands
Sometimes you need the kind of friend who can tell you why your taint is itchy
Sometimes you just need a helping hand

Sometimes you need someone who doesn't care that you're an asshole
Sometimes you need someone to listen to a song
Sometimes you wonder what degree the things you need need needing
And if any of the folks you need are needing what you have at all

The ones who have given you permanence of objects
In the parlance of our time we call them friends
Maybe they go out and do some stuff together maybe not
I really have no reference in the end

Sometimes you need another at the party
Sometimes you need to scratch that pitiable yearning
Sometimes you need someone to fix it when your browser hangs
That's my sometimes, not the other, I am learning

I'm the one who gets invited to parties
By knowing who I know and saying stupid shit
I'm the one who will be taking all your pictures
So the frame and all the ones you care for fit
