In Silico

We fought again last night
And you said you were done and I said I didn't buy it
But it's 2:22 in the morning and sleeplessly scrolling
And the number of likes isn't the same as the count of the list of the people below it
I guess the algorithm didn't catch up

You said that you liked that thing that I did
But that thing that I did now is different
Cause my frame carries the weight of a decade
And the faces you make aren't the same as the pictures you painted with your flesh back then
I guess the algorithm didn't catch up

Put through our paces
On a grid populated with nothing and unity at random
And a heart that is programmed to wither and die
Against a map of good company lain out before us and very well at the same time
I guess the algorithm didn't catch up
