The blood between the gears is running dry
The phony purpose that you've written's Coagulated in the lines
Each broken rung of chainlink galling out the cogs
To put a point on it, we're shitting on the clock

Once I said I'd perform adequately and caught some shit
Because I'm lazy and and a little bit misguided, I'll admit
But whatever the ethics of that little boast we're tired
To put a point on it, we're sleeping on the job

To put a point on it we're fighting back and building bombs
