# Check engine

The blood between the gears is running dry
The hollow purpose that you've written's Coagulated in the lines
Each broken rung of chainlink galling out the cogs
To put a point on it, we're shitting on the job

The sweating bosses see the lube is drying up
"Poke their asses get them wetter they're not working fast enough"
fluorescent meathooks run us through, wearing latex with a grin
To put a point on it we're swimming in their sin

The car we're driving's got a wobbly frame of bones
And radiator filled with tears gasping at the fumes of hope
And it's shaking and it's steaming, pull over while there's time
Keep your nuts on babe we're going for a ride


studs and leather 
And a wooden X to mark the spot she'll flay your bratty hide
ain't got nothing on a handsome tweed and a car key with a fob
To put a point on it, you're fucking your own job

The car we're driving's got a wobbly frame of bones
And radiator filled with tears, gasping at the fumes of hope
And it's shaking and it's steaming, pull over while there's time
Keep your nuts on babe we're going for a ride



To put a point on it we're fighting back and building bombs
