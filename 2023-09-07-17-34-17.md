# Check engine

The blood between the gears is running dry
The hollow purpose that you've written's Coagulated in the lines
Each broken rung of chainlink galling out the cogs
To put a point on it, we're shitting on the job

The sweating bosses see the lube is drying up
"Poke their asses get them wetter they're not working fast enough"
fluorescent meathooks run us through, wearing latex with a grin
To put a point on it we're swimming in their sin

The car we're driving's got a wobbly frame of bones
And radiator filled with tears gasping at the fumes of hope
And it's shaking and it's steaming, pull over while there's time
Keep your nuts on babe we're going for a ride

Have you ever seen an engine seize?
Do you wonder what will happen when this motor burns up its own grease?
Will it make its own, and round and round?
That's what the story says
Maybe so, but if the whole thing goes, 
the pistons get off easy and it block, it winds up dead


studs and leather 
And a wooden X to mark the spot she'll flay your bratty hide
ain't got nothing on a handsome tweed and a car key with a fob
To put a point on it, you're fucking your job

Have you ever seen an engine seize?
Do you wonder what will happen when this motor burns up its own grease?
Will it make its own, and round and round?
That's what the story says
Maybe so, but if the whole thing goes, 
the pistons get off easy and the block it winds up dead

The car we're driving's got a wobbly frame of bones
And radiator filled with tears, gasping at the fumes of hope
And it's shaking and it's steaming, pull over while there's time
Keep your nuts on babe we're going for a ride



To put a point on it we're fighting back and building bombs
