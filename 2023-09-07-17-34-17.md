The blood between the gears is running dry
The hollow purpose that you've written's Coagulated in the lines
Each broken rung of chainlink galling out the cogs
To put a point on it, we're shitting on the job

The bosses see the lube is drying up
"Poke their asses get them wetter they're not working fast enough"
Dangling from fluorescent meathooks wearing latex with a grin
To put a point on it we're swimming in their sin

Have you ever seen an engine seize?
Do you wonder what will happen when this motor burns up its own grease?
Will it make its own, and round and round?
That's what the story says
Maybe so, but if the whole thing goes, the pistons get off easy


 studs and leather 
And a wooden X to mark the spot she'll flay your bratty hide
ain't got nothing on a handsome tweed and a car key with a fob
To put a point on it, you're fucking your job

Have you ever seen an engine seize?
Do you wonder what will happen when this motor burns up its own grease?
Will it make its own, and round and round?
Maybe so, but if the whole thing goes, the pistons get off easy

You're
Cause a wobbly tower of bones holds the whole thing up

To put a point on it we're fighting back and building bombs
