Cultural currency should be currency.
As a medium of exchange of the only thing worth exchanging which is whatever contribution to society we can make.
This is the language of art.

I make a lot of references when I write songs.
I do this because it is an enjoyable way to write songs, mostly.
But also because art is memetic and there is nothing more punk than a good old fashioned subverted symbol.
And because I value shared interests and ideals and humor and experience.
And to stand on the shoulders of other serial burnouts who had something to say but couldn't figure out how.
And because I think art is gatekept based on who "gets it" and more often than not those are the types of people who have already been afforded the circumstantial privilege to figure it out, I feel some ethical and also fraternal responsibility to listeners who haven't lived the same life as me.

When I make art I want people to get it if they want to, which is why I'm taking the time to provide just a bit of symbolic exposition in the form of a glossary.
